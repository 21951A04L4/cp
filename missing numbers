class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n=len(nums)
        sum1=int((n*(n+1))/2)
        sum2=0
        for i in nums:
            sum2+=i
        return(sum1-sum2)
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
